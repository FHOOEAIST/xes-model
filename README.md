# XES - Model

XES model provides autogenerated XES domain classes based on the [XES standard](https://xes-standard.org/). 
These classes are generated using the XML schema definition files and jax-b.

## Getting Started

To use the classes, simply include the maven dependency on the project.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>science.aist</groupId>
    <artifactId>xes-model</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>compile</scope> <!-- Note: this is default -->
</dependency>
```

Then you are able to load XES files the following way:

```java
XMLRepository<LogType> repository = new LogRepository()

// load
JAXBElement<LogType> log = repository.load(inputStream);

// save
repository.save(log, outputStream);
```

### Building the XML model yourself

If you want to build the project yourself, just checkout this git repo, make sure you have jdk 11 or above installed as
well as maven 3.6.0 or above and build the project by running the maven command: `mvn package`. This results in a
jar-file inside the target folder, which can be used as a dependency in other projects.
